## Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed.

It is highly recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to install Node.js and npm.

If Yarn is not installed, you can install it globally with:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Start development server:

```
yarn dev
```

To create a production build:

```
yarn build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. ðŸŽ‰
